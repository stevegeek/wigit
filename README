* WiGit: A Git-based Wiki *
***************************

About
-----
WiGit is a simple Wiki written in PHP, using Git (http://git.or.cz/) as
a backend for tracking changes. Besides Git, this wiki makes use of Textile
(http://textile.thresholdstate.com/) for marking up text.


Features
--------
* Very simple and light
* Easily customizable using themes
* Extensive syntax for marking up text (using Textile)
* Full history tracking support
* Basic support for users/authors, by using the HTTP authentication headers
  to extract the user.
* Support for pretty URLs (using URL rewriting)


Requirements
------------
* Webserver
* PHP4
* Git


Installation
------------
* Put the WiGit dir in some place where the webserver can find it
* Make sure there's a 'data' subdir, and that it is writable by the webserver
* Copy config.php.sample to config.php, and edit config.php to reflect your
  local settings

* To add a Remote Repo (this must be done before the site is used for the first time):
  - Enable and set $REMOTE_REPO in config.php
  - Setup your remote repo , e.g. create a new repo at GitHub.
  - Setup Authentication for the web server
    Example For GitHub and Debian:
       as root:
        > ssh git@github.com
        > cat ~/.ssh/known_hosts
       Copy the first line
        > mkdir /var/www/.ssh
        > cat /var/www/.ssh/known_hosts < PASTE IN LINE
        > ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "AN EMAIL ADDRESS"
       When prompted for location of id_rsa file , Enter
          /var/www/.ssh/id_rsa
       Now set www-data as owner
        > chown www-data /var/www/.ssh/*
       Now at the end type
        > ssh-add /var/www/.ssh/id_rsa
       If this fails with an error about connecting to the agent first enter:
        > exec ssh-agent bash
       then the above command

       Now
        > cat /var/www/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
       Copy the resulting data (it is one line but will be wrapped into your console)

       Now goto your Account Settings in Github and add a SSH Public Key and
       paste in the line copied as above.


* Surf to the wigit URL, and you should start by editing the front page

For user support, configure your webserver to require authentication for
the wigit install dir. E.g.
* For Apache, add the following to .htaccess in your wigit install dir:
		AuthType Basic
		AuthName "My WiGit"
		AuthUserFile /path/to/passwords/file
		Require valid-user
* For lighttpd, add the following to your config file:
		auth.backend = "htdigest"
		auth.backend.htdigest.userfile = "/path/to/htdigest/file"
		auth.require = (
		      "/wigit" => (
							"method" => "digest",
							"realm" => "My WiGit",
							"require" => "valid-user",
						)
				)
